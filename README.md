## About this project

This project is an MVP POC and so there are plenty of rough edges, minimal tests, and I am still experimenting with cleanarchetecture around module and css.


### Installation

In the command line run:

- npm install
- webpack

- index.html is in dist by default

- to run tests, from root dir: npm test '.\src\scripts\**\*.spec.js'

#### Next Steps


 - The next thing do after refactoring some of the ugly code is to experiment more with RXjs and move everything over to custom HTML Elements.
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements]

 - get HTML in another component.
 - look into server side rendering
 - look into generating index.html
 - look into using type="module" and and see where webpack fit in, if it does
